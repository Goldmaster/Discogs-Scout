## Versioning:
Follows a bastardization of the [semver](http://semver.org/) standard:
* Patch versions will not change behavior, only the URL/settings for trackers.
* Minor versions will definitely change code, although behavior may in fact remain the same.
* Major versions will definitely change behavior, although it will only be increased at the discretion of the current maintainer.
